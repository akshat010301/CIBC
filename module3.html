        <h1>Module1</h1>
        <p>Business ethics is a study of appropriate business policies and practices regarding potentially controversial subjects, which including corporate governance, insider trading, bribery, discrimination, corporate social responsibility, and fiduciary responsibilities (Twin, 2020). It involves the application of standards of moral behavior to business situations. <span class="reference">(Ghillyer & Sexty, 24)</span></p>
        <h2>ETHICAL DILEMMA</h2>
        <p>The ethical dilemma involves a situation that requires selecting between conflicting values that are important to the employee or organization <span class="reference">(Ghillyer & Sexty, 30)</span>. As am employee of CIBC, our responsibility is to provide the services that customers need, and satisfy with customers’ expectations. For example, a customer has some question about his credit card owing, but on his online banking app showed that he has owed $800 in total, the pending transaction showed “-$376.19”, he felt panic with his credit card owing amount, in this case, I have to tell him that “Your credit card is still owing $423.81 to CIBC bank, which it is a better option to pay it back as soon as possible.”</p>
        <h2>THE ORGANIZATIONAL RESPONSIBILITY</h2>
        <p>Organizational culture can be defined as the values, beliefs, and norms shared by all the employees of that organization. The culture represents the sum of all the policies and procedures – both written and informal – from each of the functional departments in the organization in addition to the policies and procedures  that are established for the organization as a whole <span class="reference">(Ghillyer & Sexty, 48)</span>. For example, the CIBC banking has faced ethical challenges that ensure to obey. </p>
        <h2>CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY</h2>
        <p>CSR also referred to as corporate citizenship or corporate conscience – may be defined as the actions of organization that are targeted toward achieving a social benefit over and above maximizing profits for it shareholders and meeting all its legal obligations <span class="reference">(Ghillyer & Sexty, 70)</span>. For example, CIBC Bank USA Smart AccounT, the idea for frequesnt travellers who live and do business in USA, and want to transfer U.S. currency for their convenience and control. 1st, skip the currenct conversion fees, pay US bills deposits and withdraws US currency without upset about converting rate. 2nd, access your cash, withdraw funds at an ATM in USA, and CIBC banking has set up the CIBC ATMs in USA. 3rd, move your money to the USA with ease, the CIBC online banking to transfer money in real time between your CIBC Canadian account and your CIBC USA smart account.</p>

        <h2>WHISTLE BLOWER</h2>
        <p>● An employee’s personal value system prompts him or her to speak out on the misconduct, the employee immediately takes on the role of a whistle-blower <span class="reference">(Ghillyer & Sexty,144)</span>.<br>
            ● Internal whistle-blower is an employee discovering corporate misconduct and bringing it to the attention to his or her supervisor, who then follows established procedures to address the misconduct within the organization <span class="reference">(Ghillyer & Sexty,144)</span>.<br>
            ● External whistle-blower is an employee discovering corporate misconduct and choosing to bring it to the attention of law enforcement agencies and/or the media <span class="reference">(Ghillyer & Sexty,144)</span>.<br>

        </p>
        <h2>ETHICS IN TECHNOLOGY</h2>
        <p>● Technological advances often deliver new and improved functional capabilities before we have had the chance to fully consider the implications of those improvements <span class="reference">(Ghillyer & Sexty,164)</span>.<br>
            ● the Intranet technology referrs to  a company’s internal website, has information for employees access only <span class="reference">(Ghillyer & Sexty,164)</span>.<br>
            ● the Extranet technology refers to  a private piece of a company’s internet network that made available to customers and/or vendor pertners on the basis of secured access by unique passwork <span class="reference">(Ghillyer & Sexty,164)</span>.<br>
            As a CIBC employee, he must keep the CIBC’s business secret to his colleague and his boss, and he must not share it with customers.<br>
            As a customer who has bank account of CIBC, he has to keep his bank information personally, to avoid his money or card get stole, and the thief with use his debit or credit card.
        </p>
        <h2>ETHICS AND GLOBALIZATION</h2>
        <p>Once we step outside the domestic environment and conduct business on an international or a global scale, the concept of business ethics changes dramatically <span class="reference">(Ghillyer & Sexty,188).</span></p>

        <h2>Overview of Guiding Ethical Theories</h2>
        <p> Virtue ethics: Virtue ethics is more concerned personally – what sort of person I would like to become, and how do I go about becoming that person. 
            The problem with virtue ethics is that societies can places different emphasis on different virtues. For example, Greek society at the time of Aristotle valued wisdom, courage, and justice.
            By contrast, Christian society valued faith, hope, and charity. <span class="reference">(Ghillyer & Sexty, 2017, p.6)</span><br>
            
             Utilitarianism:  This ethics is for the greater good. It focuses more on the outcome of the actions rather than virtue actions themselves. It is proposed by Scottish philosopher named David Hume.
            The problem with this idea is that it’s end justify it’s meaning. If we only focus on doing great, no one is accountable of the actions taken to achieve them. <span class="reference">(Ghillyer & Sexty, 2017, p.6)</span><br>
            
             Universal ethics: It is proposed by a Greek philosopher named Immanuel Kant. It is like a law. Actions are taken on the basis of duty and obligation, rather than the needs of the situation. It applies to everyone, everywhere, all the time. <span class="reference">(Ghillyer & Sexty, 2017, p.7)</span>

        </p>

        <h2>Addressing Ethical Challenges to various departments:</h2>
        <h2>Research and Develepment</h2>
        <p>Research and development department is reponsible for the future growth of the company. It is obvious that a company would lose it’s customers if they don’t provide them with new products. 
            They also have a responsibility of providing the customers with highest quality, safety and reliable products. Defective products can cause customer lose and negative media coverage.
            For the R&D team, real ethical dilemma comes when they have to make decisions regarding the product quality- do we use the best material available or the second best to do some cost cuting and saving money. <span class="reference">(Ghillyer & Sexty, 2017, p.49)</span>
        </p>
        <h2>Manufacturing</h2>
        <p>Managers complain about the R&D department because the design is being thrown to the manufacturing department with the implication that they should meet all the requirements. Then it falls under manufacturing to make the things work out. 
            The ethical question faced by manufacturing is “do you want it built fast, or do you want it built right? They also have to look after their competitor. <span class="reference">(Ghillyer & Sexty, 2017, p.50)</span>
        </p>
        <h2>Marketing</h2>
        <p>Once the manufacturing department delivers the finish product, it’s marketing department’s responsibility now to sell the product. Their only motive is to earn customer satisfaction. If the marketers do their research correctly and send their report to R&D accurately, and can assume the product will meet the customers needs, and the competitor hasn’t beaten you to market with their new product, this should be a slam dunk, but with all assumptions, a great deal can go wrong. <span class="reference">(Ghillyer & Sexty, 2017, p.51)</span></p>
        <h2>Human Resource</h2>
        <p>Responsibilities that comes under human resource department are:<br>
            •	The creation of the job description for the position.<br>
            •	The recruitment and selection of the right candidate for the position.<br>
            •	The orientation of the new hired employee.<br>
            •	Efficiently managing payroll and benefits for the employees.<br>
            •	The documentation of the periodic performance reviews.<br>
            •	The documentation of disciplinary behaviour and remedial training, if needed.<br>
            •	The creation of a career development program for the employee. <span class="reference">(Ghillyer & Sexty, 2017, p.53)</span>
        </p>
        <h2>Finance</h2>
        <p>•	Financial transactions is the flow of money by which the organisation is handled. It involves receiving money from customers, using the money to pay employees, suppliers and all other creditors, left with some profit eventually which can be re-invested or paid out to owners and shareholders. <span class="reference">(Ghillyer & Sexty, 2017, p.54)</span><br>
            •	The accounting functions, keeps note of the financial transactions by recording the money coming in (credit) and money going out (debit) and balancing the amounts at the end of the period. The accounting can be handled by a professional hired by the company. <span class="reference">(Ghillyer & Sexty, 2017, p.54)</span><br>
            •	When financial books of business are balanced, then that must be reported to numerous interested parties. As an organization grows, it eventually goes public by selling stock in the organization on a public stock exchange, the need for certified documents get even greater. <span class="reference">(Ghillyer & Sexty, 2017, p.55)</span><br>
        </p>
        <h1>Module 3 – Activity</h1>
        <p>In this activity, employees will use their cell phones to search real world situations that demanded ethical decision making. Once they have found a situation, they will analyze it. This activity is geared especially for millennials who favor the use of technology <span class="reference">(Paul, 2016)</span></p>
        <h2>Activity directions:</h2>
        <p>1.	Arrange employees into groups of three.<br>
            2.	Each group will find an ethical dilemma that has happened in the “real world.” This dilemma should pertain to the business or industry of your company.<br>
            3.	Participants will analyze the situation and determine:<br>
            •	What was the actual dilemma?<br>
            •	What were the possible choices?<br>
            •	What was the actual choice taken?<br>
            •	What would be the best course of action?<br>
            4.	Participants will then share their findings with the whole group. <span class="reference">(Paul, 2016)</span>

        <h2>Leadership</h2>
        <p>Corporate governance comprehensively alludes to the instruments, relations, and procedures by which a partnership is controlled and is coordinated; includes adjusting the numerous interests of the stakeholders of an organization. (Ghillyer & Sexty,2017, p.94).  Long term achievement requires compelling administration. The Board of Directors and the board of CIBC are focused on greatness in such manner. While CIBC has just been perceived as a pioneer around there, we endeavor every year for consistent upgrades in our administration structure and procedures. <span class="reference">(Corporate Governance, 2019)</span>
            CIBC's senior management team plays a key role in the overall governance of CIBC's businesses by providing timely and accurate information to the Board to assist the directors in their oversight responsibilities. Regular and candid interaction between the Board and management is another key aspect of strong governance to support the long-term interests of CIBC's stakeholders. <span class="reference">(Corporate Governance, 2019)</span>.
